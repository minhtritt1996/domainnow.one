										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body">
<p>If you read nothing else today, read this: stop buying $100-$300 SEO packages for your small business if you ever want your site to rank. If not, the cleanup effort needed after most companies in that price range are finished will break the bank. That is before you take recovery time into account too.</p>
<p><span id="more-595"></span> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Red Adair put it so eloquently, <em>&#8220;If you think it&#8217;s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur.&#8221;</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, if you can&#8217;t afford $1,000+ per month but you still want to slowly improve visibility, there are some safe ways to do so. To save you time though, you should know that if you are a law firm in NYC, a real estate agent in LA, or a business with similar competition, you won&#8217;t get far. However, if you are in a less competitive niche and location, even the small things will move the needle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, we are going to cover 3 simple but actionable steps you can take to safely move your small businesses online visibility in the right direction. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Setup Your GMB and Get Reviews </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an extremely simple step that small local businesses continue to overlook. If you don&#8217;t have your GMB listing setup, go to <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business</a> and it will walk you through the steps. Make sure you add pictures and get the completion status to 100%. Once created, you will get a verification post card in the mail, after that make sure you reach out to current satisfied customers and ask them to leave you a review on your GMB listing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Create Citations &amp; Niche Directory Links<br /></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Local business citations and niche directories are two inexpensive types of links that can give you a boost.  For business citations, one of the easiest ways to find a list of sites is by searching for one (literally just search &#8220;list of top citation sites&#8221;) &#8211; here is <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/fuel/business-listing-citation-sites-usa/">one good example</a>.</p>
<p>That list will give you 60+ places to go and list your business. Just as you did above, take the time to fill out reach listing completely to maximize the likelihood of it being indexed and counted by Google.</p>
<p>Once you have worked through the full list, head back over to Google and search for a list of niche specific directories. You are looking for high quality sites only, here is an example.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you are a Vet, go to Google and search &#8220;list of top directories for veterinarians&#8221; and boom, you will see curated lists of sites you can go out and get listed on. Since you are looking for quality, I would visit 5 or 10 sites and make note of which directories are mentioned on most of the sites. After you have a short list, go to Google and type: site: (then the url of the directory). For example, <em>site:websitemagazine.com</em></p>
<p>This will tell you how many pages are indexed. If the site has only a few indexed pages or none, cross it off the list. Once you work through the list, you will have at least a handful of niche specific directories that you can list your business on.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Blog for Others</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If your site is new, you don&#8217;t rank, and you don&#8217;t have an audience, go out and find someone who does. If you are starting a water restoration company, find local plumbers with a blog on their site and contribute content educating people about the restoration process, what to expect after the leak is stopped and so on. This can also be done on niche sites, go to Google and search &#8220;write for us&#8221; +&#8221;kitchen remodeling&#8221; (insert your niche in place of kitchen remodeling) and you can easily find sites that are interested in guest posts. If you can&#8217;t write, hire a freelancer to do it for you or search for a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blogger+outreach+services&amp;oq=blogger+outrea&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i60l2.2695j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">blogger outreach service</a> to handle the full process if you have a bit more money to invest.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It is very easy to get completely overwhelmed whenever you are just getting started. As you learn more about SEO, there are countless tactics, hacks, tricks, and tips that can be applied. The biggest mistake I see people make is never getting started.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three tips above are meant to be both simple and actionable. If you read this and you haven&#8217;t completed those items already, set a timeline and get to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the words of Theodore Roosevelt: <em>&#8220;In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body">
<p><strong>Most search engine optimization professionals realize that citations (links) are a key aspect of optimizing a website for competitive placement on the search engines &#8211; and they aren&#8217;t wrong. </strong></p>
<p><em>In the case of Google, however, there&#8217;s more to ranking a website than just the number and quality of inbound links &#8211; and we&#8217;re not talking about site speed or information architecture.</em></p>
<p>SEO professionals optimizing a website for Google today (as well as in the past) are likely all too familiar with the concept of PageRank, which is Google&#8217;s system of counting links to determine which pages are most important (and deserving of higher rankings). </p>
<p>There is another &#8220;factor&#8221; however that may play an equally important role in ranking but does not nearly get the attention it deserves, and it goes by the name of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CheiRank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CheiRank</a></strong>. </p>
<p>While PageRank identifies very well-known and popular nodes, CheiRank highlights very &#8220;communicative&#8221; nodes. In essence, Google is not only measuring the quantity and quality of inbound links (elements that have been clearly demonstrated to influence PageRank), but also websites that communicate to other nodes via links on their own website (CheiRank). </p>
<p>How do these ranking mechanisms actually work? According to Wikipedia: </p>
<p><em>PageRank selects first articles on a broadly known subject with a large number of ingoing links while CheiRank selects first highly communicative articles with many outgoing links.</em></p>
<p>CheiRank will prove to be rather interesting to search engine optimization professionals, who have likely never previously come across the concept, as it clearly indicates that search engines do indeed consider far more than just links. In other words, providing well-developed, well-cited sources (content that links liberally outwardly) is another way to capture more organic/natural traffic from the search engines.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body">
<h2>One of the most common stumbling blocks for brands looking to expand their international reach is making sure the right content is delivered to the right user through the search engines. </h2>
<p> Websites that have similar content in several different languages risk not only serving up a version of a page that is not optimized for the user&#8217;s language or location, they may also be prone to duplicate content problems in the virtual eyes of the search engines. With a little awareness and some time spent on implementation, however, websites can avoid these issues by setting up what are known as<br />
<strong>hreflang tags</strong> (supported currently only by Google and Yandex). </p>
<p>Hreflang tags are used to mark up pages that are similar in meaning but aimed at different languages and/or regions. This can be used for content with regional variations, content in different languages, or a combination of different languages and regional variations &#8211; there are hundreds if not thousands of possible combinations.<br />
<br /> <br />
</p>
<p>    <br />
<br />Below are a few basics to remember for search engine optimization professionals as they begin to address broader SEO internationalization efforts and implementing hreflang tags on their own website.  </p>
<p><strong>1) Focus on Language Specification First, Then Region</strong><br />
<br />Don&#8217;t be overly specific when it comes to hreflang implementation. It&#8217;s quite common, for example, for consumers to speak the same language but live in different geographic areas. In this case, it is best to plan out the experience so that marketers can correctly focus (at least in the early stages) on who each page is intended for. 
</p>
<p><strong>2) Implement Valid Attributes</strong><br />
<br />Correctly developed hreflang attributes contain a value that reveals the language as well as indicates the region (the second half being optional). Verify that the<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right hreflang language attributes</a> and regional attribute (<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regional attribute list</a>) are being used correctly and in the right format to avoid most implementation problems and ensure the optimal experience. 
</p>
<p><strong>3) Develop/Verify Return Links</strong><br />
<br />Each URL needs return links to every other URL and should point at the canonical version. That means a site with 50 different languages will require hreflang links for 50 different URLs. 
</p>
<p><strong>4) Self-Referencing</strong><br />
<br />Correct hreflang implementation also requires a self-link; a hreflang link that points directly at the current page. While it does seem a little strange to link to the same page a user is on, it is required and failing to self-reference could cause big problems. 
</p>
<p><strong>5) Technical Implementation </strong><br />
<br />There are three different ways to implement hreflang &#8211; using link elements in the , using HTTP headers or using an XML sitemap. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks and the optimal implementation will vary from website to website.
</p>
<p><strong>6) Make It Easier</strong><br />
<br />There are several tools that search engine optimization professionals can use to make hreflang implementation a little easier. Aleyda Solis&#8217;<br />
<a href="https://www.aleydasolis.com/en/international-seo-tools/hreflang-tags-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hreflang tag generator</a>, for example, is a helpful resource to developing all the required return links while the<br />
<a href="https://www.themediaflow.com/tool_hreflang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hreflang XML sitemap generator</a> from The Media Flow can be provided a CSV with URLs for each language to create a sitemap to manage the more complex technical implementation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body">
<p><strong>Properly optimizing your local business website can not only allow you to rank more quickly, it can also enable you to rank for multiple variations of your most important keywords.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-588"></span> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A proper on page setup for local SEO goes beyond the page title and mentioning your city on the page. If you are confident in the basics of your website, here are some more advanced steps you should take to continue your on-page optimization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your home page serves two main purposes in local SEO &#8211; to establish you as a legitimate brand and to establish the primary service your business offers, much the same purpose as in organic SEO. The &#8220;keyword&#8221; for your home page is generally the primary category you chose when setting up your GMB listing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are a painting company, your home page title would be something like: <em>&#8220;City Painting Services | Your Brand Name&#8221;</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Building Supporting Local Content</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When it comes to internal pages you will also leverage GMB categories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To begin building out your internal pages, you first need to identify which of the services you offer have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QhWFmHYhZI7FL7cQZUqkDkRbexPVthEIfp8iibhA3s/edit#gid=1618773282">GMB category</a> of their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, if you are a painting company, the first internal page you will build out is <em>yoursite.com/painter</em> because &#8220;painter&#8221; is the main GMB category. This will be the same keyword used on the home page, but, the home page should have a brand focus whereas this page will focus on the service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once that page is setup, and the category is part of the URL, the next step is to build out supporting content on the page. To do this, you should be looking for supporting sub-topics of the main category.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using the &#8220;painter&#8221; example again, you should next create your heading tags. Here are some example terms that should appear in H2 sub-headings on this page:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>City + house painters</li>
<li>Commercial painters + city</li>
<li>Exterior home painting + city</li>
<li>Cabinet refinishing + city</li>
<li>Deck painting</li>
<li>Fence Painting</li>
</ul>
<p>Up until now, you will have established a few things. First, Google will see you are a brand and what your overall service category is. Second, your have re-enforced your primary category by creating an internal page with the category in the URL structure. Third, you have now setup sub-headings on your main page that tells users and Google about the specific types of painting services that you offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that you have setup the outline for your page, you will need to fill in the supporting content. To do this, the SEMrush topic research tool works great, if you don&#8217;t use SEMrush, you can also go to Google and search each sub-heading, then record a list of related searches and the autocomplete suggestions for those headings as well.  Here is what it will look like if you do use SEMrush:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.websitemagazine.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/house-painters-semrush-1-1-1.png" data-displaymode="Original" alt="house-painters-semrush" title="house-painters-semrush" sfref="[images|OpenAccessDataProvider]256ef98e-c5e1-63ac-bc5d-ff0000ff1aaa"/> </p>
<p>Above, this tool helps us uncover two important pieces of information. First, on the left side, you will see a mind map, showing some related ideas. One such example in this case is &#8220;pressure washing&#8221;. Since painters often must pressure wash the exterior of a home before painting it, many painters also offer pressure washing services. This would make a good general theme for another page on the site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specific to the current page though, the list of questions can be used to create filler content. One question people ask about exterior painting is <em>&#8220;how much does exterior painting cost?&#8221; </em>Your answer to this could be used as a bullet point list item under the exterior painting heading or as the topic of a paragraph under the same heading. Repeat this process until you have filled in each subheading on your page.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Setting Up Your Silos</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal of the H2 headings and the content beneath them is not to create the most extensive guide on the internet, it is simply to define to users and Google what specific painting services you offer. In addition, it serves as the foundation for building out supporting pages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say on the main painting page you used these H2 headings:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchen Cabinet Refinishing</li>
<li>Deck Pressure Washing and Paint Restoration</li>
</ul>
<p>Your next step would be to create a page specific to your cabinet refinishing service. Your main painting page would then link out to the cabinet specific page on your site as a resource for further learning and the cabinet page would link back to the main painting pages, alluding to the other services a person often requests from a painting company.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The &#8220;Deck Pressure Washing and Paint Restoration&#8221; example would link out to two pages. First, if you offer restorative painting or refinishing, a page about that specific service should be linked below this heading, just as in the above example.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next, if you offer pressure washing and you have created a service page specific to pressure washing, you should also link to that page. Even better, if you have setup a pressure washing page with subheadings such as &#8220;deck pressure washing&#8221;, which you built out a specific page on, linking to yoursite.com/deck-pressure-washing-restoration would be the best move.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The concept discussed here today is not a new one, but it is an effective one. Understanding how to structure your site for local SEO starting at the home page and working your way to 3<sup>rd</sup> level supporting pages can give you a significant advantage over sites without a clear structure. In addition to ranking more quickly, you will also start to notice rankings for a lot of related keywords in maps when using this approach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure where to start, grab a pen and paper and write down the main service you offer. After that, write down main 3-5 specific services customers request from you. Next, write down 3 questions you here about each of those services regularly. Even though this isn&#8217;t a perfect approach, it may be exactly what you need to get the ball rolling. SEO isn&#8217;t about being perfect, it is about being better than your competitors so don&#8217;t let the fear of imperfection keep you from getting started today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body"><strong>Technology providers are moving quickly to attract former enterprise-level users of Google Site Search and the Google Search Appliance.</strong> </p>
<p>SearchBlox, for example, a provider of search, sentiment analysis and text analytics solution, recently launched version 8.6 of its software and it could be just the feature set enterprises are looking for to serve as a replacement.
</p>
<p>This version of the<br />
<a href="https://www.websitemagazine.com/software/enterprise-search-gets-elastic-at-searchblox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SearchBlox</a> software incorporates the 5.1 release of the Elastic Stack for Elasticsearch and Kibana and allows for the easy setup of a SearchBlox cluster using the Web UI, and provides connectors to ingest data from 75+ data sources including websites, databases and custom data feeds. The new version also allows use of SQL to access data indexed from different repositories.
</p>
<p>&#8220;SearchBlox was an early adopter of Elasticsearch and continues to leverage new features of Elasticsearch to offer our customers a robust and highly scalable enterprise search solution.&#8221; said Timo Selvaraj, Co-Founder and VP of Product Management at SearchBlox. &#8220;In addition, SearchBlox&#8217;s evolution into a cognitive platform for unstructured data supporting features like text analytics, sentiment analysis, entity extraction and machine learning has been simplified by using other Elastic products like Kibana&#8221;
</p>
<p>SearchBlox has already reportedly migrated more than 100 customers from Google Search Appliance (GSA) to the SearchBlox Enterprise Search platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body"><strong>Consumers still rely on search engines to locate the information they need or want &#8211; whether it&#8217;s very specific content on some obscure topic or simply to find out what&#8217;s on the menu this week at their favorite local restaurant. </strong> </p>
<p>Most small businesses have neither the time nor the inclination to routinely, consistently publish information on their digital channels. That could most certainly change however as Google My Business (GMB) is formally introducing its Posts offering. 
</p>
<p>The feature, which was initially introduced in beta in early-mid 2016 on a limited basis, makes it possible for business owners to share content that will encourage customers (either new or existing) to take advantage of specific offers or events, showcase top products or highlight new arrivals.
</p>
<p>Available within the GMB dashboard now, interested business owners/marketers can write text (up to 300 words), upload an image, add an event title (along with start and end dates and times), and even include a call-to-action button such as &#8220;Learn more,&#8221; &#8220;Reserve,&#8221; &#8220;Sign up,&#8221; &#8220;Buy&#8221; or &#8220;Get offer.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>GMB Posts could prove to be a rather immersive experience for consumers as businesses are able to publish multiple posts in somewhat of an &#8216;update stream&#8217; and direct those consumers to take specific actions &#8211; from registering for events to actually purchasing items. 
</p>
<p>The feature will likely be very well received by those using the GMB, and could forever change the local search landscape; not to mention challenge other platforms (including Facebook) who have shown a great deal of interest in becoming a greater force in helping small business owners (particularly of the local variety) engage their audience and drive more businesses through their doors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body">
<h2>Voice search is poised to be one of the most disruptive forces in the digital landscape in the next several years (if not decades) as the &#8220;smart assistants&#8221; (including but not limited to devices such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc.) take over. </h2>
<p><strong>As the technology powering them (machine learning, artificial intelligence) becomes increasingly sophisticated, their use is only expected to become even more widespread.</strong> </p>
<p><span id="more-582"></span> </p>
<p>Fortunately, marketers have an opportunity right now to position their brand and its information in the path of consumers as they interact with these digital devices and gather data on their level of interest in and familiarity with a particular topic, perhaps their position/location in the sales funnel based on a search history, and more, along the way. </p>
<p>The practice of &#8220;<em>voice search optimization</em>&#8221; has already begun for many of the savviest brands. It appears that advertisers using <a href="https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google&#8217;s keyword planner tool</a>, for example, are encountering and being exposed to what looks to be keyword ideas/suggestions based on actual voice search queries. Expect the trend to continue and that specific functionality to improve as Google moves toward its &#8220;mobile-first&#8221; index in the coming months and years. </p>
<p>What, however, are the specific terms being used by &#8216;<em>your</em>&#8216; prospective audience? What does an SEO need to do to find these queries, integrate them into their own optimization initiatives and measure the results of the performance accrued over time? Slow your roll&#8230; you likely already know the answer (because you&#8217;ve been told this before). </p>
<h3>What advertisers and marketers are discovering about voice search (and voice search optimization) is that outside of longer queries being used in general, the type of content being sought out by consumers isn&#8217;t all that different from what has been sought out by them in the past. In short, consumers are looking for answers and it is your responsibility (as the brand or the SEO) to deliver them. </h3>
<p><em>Website Magazine&#8217;s</em> &#8220;<a href="https://www.websitemagazine.com/seo/aim-to-please-with-knowledge-base-optimization-kbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aim to Please with KBO (Knowledge Base Optimization)</a>&#8221; article, for example, provides a strong foundation and some practical guidance (still relevant and useful six years later) for delivering an optimized search experience and driving brand exposure with those looking for answers and guidance. SEO professionals may also want to try out a solution like <a href="https://answerthepublic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Answer The Public</a>, a Web-based offering that provides content ideas in the form of questions based on the keyword entered (to which SEOs can apply an answer). </p>
<p>Focusing on the long-tail search terms and phrases provided by keyword suggestion tools and developing content of a more informational variety however only gets SEOs so far. You also need to be lucky (and super good at link building). While search engine optimization professionals have long recommended that website owners develop content that answers the questions of their users, the search engine experience provided by Google has evolved over time. The search engine now uses a far broader set of signals to identify the best result, but it is showing that lone &#8220;best&#8221; result in ways much different than before. </p>
<p>In order to be this elusive lone result (and likely the result that will be provided as the response to a query from a user&#8217;s smart device) it is becoming increasingly evident that being rewarded with the <a href="https://www.websitemagazine.com/blog/in-pursuit-of-featured-snippets-in-google-search">featured snippet</a> is the only way to get there. There is a shocking lack of guidance and information available about optimizing for the featured snippet but for those looking to fully capitalize on the trend consider reviewing <em>Website Magazine&#8217;s </em><a href="https://www.websitemagazine.com/blog/semantic-markup-crash-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Markup Crash Course</a> to get up to speed on one of the first steps of capturing the increasingly important position available through voice search. </p>
<p>Successfully optimizing for voice search requires a deep understanding of what users need and the ability to develop content that answers their requests. When brands and SEOs can deliver on that, they&#8217;ll be fully present on smart devices when the time is right. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body">
<p><strong>A proper internal linking structure can benefit your website and business in more than one way. If a site visitor engages with a great piece of content that in turn links to related resources, they are going to stick around longer. The more time they spend on your site, the more likely they are to convert. In addition to user engagement, proper internal linking can also improve your visibility in search.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-580"></span> </p>
<p>The topic of internal linking can be somewhat confusing, especially if you are a less experienced marketer. Today we are going to simplify the process so that you can set up your site to perform optimally and as a bonus, you will also generate some new content ideas in the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Grocery Store Formula</strong></p>
<p>Close your eyes for just a moment and picture an aisle at Wal-Mart (or your favorite grocery store) and think about how items are organized. Each aisle or display is organized using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Related Items from the Same Top-Level Category (crackers)</li>
<li>Items That Are Used Together to Create a Finished Product (marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers)</li>
<li>Items That Shoppers Use Concurrently (charcoal, lighter fluid, tongs for the grill)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we take a closer look at each, you can see why Google likes internal linking just as much as shoppers like organized aisles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Related Items</strong></p>
<p>Imagine if you went to the cracker aisle in your grocery store and they had a single box of saltine crackers. Unless you needed saltines, you would likely be forced to go to another grocery store to find the ones you need. This is just the same as if a user comes to your site searching out information on a broad topic and does not find internal links to more specific subpages.  What happens in both cases is the shopper/visitor will be forced to leave and find another place that can meet their needs. What&#8217;s more, if the visitor identifies your site as having just one piece of information (or a single box of crackers) they are far less likely to return to your site when they need information on that topic in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the flipside, if you visit a grocery store for crackers and they have all the most common types neatly organized, you are more likely to return to that store next time you need crackers. That is the real-life version of good UX.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ingredients to A Recipe</strong></p>
<p>This is one area that a lot of sites are not setup to take advantage of. With Fall in full swing, campfires and S&#8217;mores are very popular right now, at least everywhere the temperature is cool. In response to this, stores like Wal-Mart will create displays that have Hershey&#8217;s chocolate, graham crackers, marshmallows, and even the sticks to roast marshmallows (see image). In some cases, they will even put them near fire pits and bundles of firewood. If you apply that to your website, items that otherwise seem unrelated (marshmallows and wood for example) are closely related in the right context.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.websitemagazine.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/smores-1-1-1.png" data-displaymode="Original" alt="smores" title="smores"/></p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.bystephanielynn.com/2015/05/smores-bar-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image source</a> by Stephanie Lynn)</p>
<p>Whether you sell products or services you can apply this same approach to your site. If for example you sell SEO services you may connect the pages for link audits, content audits, site speed cleanup, and link building to each other (or combine as one offer) because those are ingredients used to make a better ranking website. Doing so not only makes it easier to convert visitors into buyers, it also makes it easier for them to discover items they may not have realized they needed in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Items Used Concurrently</strong></p>
<p>Like ingredients of a recipe, stores also group items commonly used at the same time, but for various reasons. For example, a picnic pack with ketchup, mustard, and relish, a bag of charcoal, a game of horseshoes, and folding chairs could all be setup near each other. Although these items are not part of a single recipe, they are commonly used items during a cookout.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Online you should also be interlinking items that a visitor may need for a certain task as well. If you sell automotive accessories for example, you could link content about non-scratch cleaning brushes to content about rim polish, wax, and even a high-pressure nozzle for the garden hose. Again, this is because these items are all a part of washing your car.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip: The Recipe</strong></p>
<p>Have you even been in the store and picked up a recipe? Sometimes on a tear off card, other times on the back of a box or bag? In some cases, you may even know only a few of the ingredients to a dish and are hoping to find a recipe so you know what else to buy. Take chocolate chips for instance, a key ingredient in chocolate chip cookies. Even if you don&#8217;t know the full recipe, you know you need those. To help the cause, most bags contain a full recipe so that you know exactly what to buy. This benefits the chocolate chip company in a couple of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have the steps to reach your goal, you are more likely to buy the chocolate chips</li>
<li>They can suggest other ingredients from their parent company.</li>
<li>They can expose you to new recipes of variations that can earn your repeat business.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technique also works great online. Instead of a &#8220;recipe&#8221; it is often presented as a &#8220;how to&#8221; guide that uses the product or service of the company creating the post, or an affiliate product. In either case, making the product or service an ingredient to the big picture makes selling it an easier task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are an SEO agency that wants sell to content marketing services, a guide outlining a recipe to go from zero to 100,000 visitors in six months that relies heavily upon content is a good way to &#8220;soft sell&#8221; your service.</p>
<p>It is easy to get wrapped up in our own little worlds and try to re-invent the wheel unnecessarily. Sometimes all it takes is a look at what we encounter in our everyday life to realize the solution to many problems has already been invented, it just needs to be adapted to your situation. The store layout of Wal-Mart is a perfect example of just that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body"><strong>Search engine optimization professionals watch any and every new development at Google that may positively or negatively influence the placement of their listings. An announcement from the company this week, however, shows why fundamental SEO practices remain important.  </strong> </p>
<p>Google has expanded the length allowed in the meta description tag from 160 allowable characters to 320, providing SEOs an opportunity to use additional text to promote their websites on the search results page. Google is also reportedly increasing the size of the search snippet as well. 
</p>
<p>The meta description tag, for the unfamiliar, is an HTML tag that appears in the section of an HTML Web page; it usually looks like this:
</p>
<p>In the past, the meta description tag gave search engines and visitors more information about the contents of a page, but Google has repeatedly stated they don&#8217;t use the description for ranking purposes. Instead, they opt to use a snippet from the page that is most relevant to the user&#8217;s query. 
</p>
<p>That raises an important question: If Google just uses a snippet from the page anyway why would they care about expanding the description?  
</p>
<p>Perhaps Google is simply using the expanded meta data as a form of confirmation that their algorithms for detecting and selecting the most important snippet of the page for the user query are correct by checking what has been defined in the HTML by its producer (i.e., the website&#8217;s manager/owner). 
</p>
<p>That would certainly be a logical course of action for Google, but what happens when there is no &#8220;fallback&#8221; description for their system to use as confirmation, validation or verification? If Google can&#8217;t find a meta description on a page and can&#8217;t determine on its own the most appropriate and relevant snippet it may not show a description or a snippet at all. And that&#8217;s a problem. 
</p>
<p>If there is a meta description available, however, Google could potentially use that data to analyze for use within a snippet. 
</p>
<p>So, maybe Google is just using this expansion of the meta description as a way to signal to webmasters and SEOs that they remain an integral part in the search engine&#8217;s ability to index, analyze, rank and turn pages for users. 
</p>
<p>The takeaway in either case should be that meta descriptions still matter. Moving forward, consider taking advantage of the expanded meta descriptions while keeping an eye on its relevance and suitability to the user&#8217;s query. You never know, it could end up as a featured snippet or as part of your page&#8217;s description.</p>
